# This repository is for sharing files, exploring data and testing new models.  
- Contains a tutorial on the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. 
- Contains a notebook that performs exploratory data analysis on a Game of thrones dataset. 
## Winter is coming !!!
- Contains a script that is adapted from the following [tutorial](https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_with_vision_transformer/) that implements the [Vision Transformer (ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) model on the mnist dataset. This is a WIP, I plan to create a notebook which can be used to gain more in-depth understanding of the model.
